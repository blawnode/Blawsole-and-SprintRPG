# Blawsole and Sprint RPG
 Pygame game console, and a Sprint RPG clone.
 
 The project showcases several useful methodologies/features:
 - **Meaningful code splitting**: File imports, classes, methods.\
  Includes method nesting, like "Hit()", in BlawsoleSprintRPG.py's "start_sprint_game()".
 - **Content adaptibility**. It's very easy to add new content like enemies, attack patterns and sounds.
 - **A basic CLI**. A very simplistic CLI (Command-Line Interface) menu to choose which game you want to play next.
